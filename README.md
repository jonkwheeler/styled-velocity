# Tis a bit old ðŸ‘´

While you can still use this package, I recommend giving my `emotion` based package called [`styled-velocity-emotion`](https://github.com/jonkwheeler/styled-velocity-emotion) a shot. I'll update this one when I have time. It's smaller, faster, better.

# Styled-Velocity

Styled-Velocity, a React-based styled prop and UI library to increase your velocity and help build your Design System.

## Install

```js
yarn add styled-velocity
```

or

```js
npm install styled-velocity
```

## sharedProps

Import example:

```js
import { appearanceProps, cssProps, dimensionProps } from 'styled-velocity'
```

## Components

**All of the following have access to the sharedProps.**

Import example:

```js
import { Element } 'styled-velocity'
```

## Breakpoints

### About

All of the sharedProps can take a single value, or an object of Breakpoints. You have all the choices you could possibly use for creating style within breakpoints. This system is _mobile first_, but there's several ways to mix it up.

### Example

Let's using the `width` css property for the following examples...

##### No breakpoint

```js
w={50}
```

##### Mobile: 50, Tablet: 100, Desktop: 150

If you want to create a breakpoint, supply an object, and use the key as the breakpoint. Make sure to give the lowest a `0`, if it's min-width 0, it won't wrap it in a media query.

```js
w={{ 0: 50, 768: 100, 1024: 150 }}
```

returns

```css
width: 50px;

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  width: 100px;
}
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  width: 150px;
}
```

##### Mobile: 50, Tablet: 100, Desktop

If you want to create a breakpoint that has min and max, supply a key that is a string like so...

```js
w={{ '768-1024': 100 }}
```

returns

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  width: 100px;
}
```

Pretty cool, eh?

### Scaling Font Sizes

This min-max string key is how the scaling pixel values work. If you wanted to scale anything from one pixel value to another, like `font-size` for instance, you can do this...

```js
fontSize={{
  0: 12,
  '414-1023': { min: 12, max: 36 },
  1024: 36
}}
```

returns

```css
font-size: 12px;

@media (min-width: 414px) and (max-width: 1023px) {
  A css formula to scale the font-size from 12px to 36px based on screen width
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  font-size: 36px;
}
```

## conversionType

Notice the `conversionType`? This should clue you into what is possible for the given prop.

### percentageOrPixel

You can pass is an `int` like `50` and it'll convert to `50px`. You can pass it a fraction, like `1 / 2` and it'll convert to a `50%`. You can also just pass a string like `50em`.

### booleanToIntString

Used for grow and shrink, if you pass `true`, it'll convert to `1` for css purposes. And `false` to `0`.

### getCells

This takes an `int` and converts it to the cells width (or height). Thus `cw={2}` makes the element 2 cells wide (based on your grid config).

### getCellsTranslate

Similar to `getCells`, but takes an object. `ctransform={{ 0: {x: 0.5, y: 0} }}` would offset the x coords of the element by 1/2 cells width.

### getFlexProperty

Flex has some pretty unintuitive properties. For instance, `valign="top"` refers to the vertical alignment an element (assuming you staying with direction=row). You can of course pass the original css flex properties as well if you are used to them.

| input	| output 	|
|---	|---	|
| top 	| flex-start	|
| left 	| flex-start	|
| start 	| flex-start	|
| bottom 	| flex-end	|
| right 	| flex-end	|
| end 	| flex-end	|
| middle 	| center	|
| center 	| center	|


## Polyfill

In order to use this package on IE, you'll need a polyfill for `String.prototype.includes`. You can do this with loading a polyfill script from https://polyfill.io/, such as 

```<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=String.prototype.includes" async></script>```

### Using Next.js?

With Next.js you can load polyfills another way. See https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-polyfills/client/polyfills.js.

Add following to `client/polyfills.js`

~~~js
/*
 * This files runs at the very beginning (even before React and Next.js core)
 * https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-polyfills/client/polyfills.js
 */

/* eslint no-extend-native: 0 */
// core-js comes with Next.js. So, you can import it like below
import stringIncludes from 'core-js/library/fn/string/virtual/includes'

// Add your polyfills
String.prototype.includes = stringIncludes
~~~

And then modify the `next.config.js`

~~~js
// next.config.js

const nextConfig = {
  webpack(config) {

    /*
     * Add polyfills
     * https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-polyfills/next.config.js
     */

    const originalEntry = config.entry
    config.entry = async () => {
      const entries = await originalEntry()

      if (entries['main.js'] && !entries['main.js'].includes('./client/polyfills.js')) {
        entries['main.js'].unshift('./client/polyfills.js')
      }

      return entries
    }

    return config
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
~~~
